# Big Enough Flurry Edition

Build in a world that’s big enough. Set after the great Minecraft world war, your king has set you out on a quest into a world far beyond the castle walls where he wants you to seek out materials (and loot) to rebuild his kingdom. Because of the war, creatures have gained considerable strength but your wizard has pacified all creatures in the realm so they won’t attack unless you attack first.
